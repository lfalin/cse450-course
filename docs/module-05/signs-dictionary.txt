# Training Images

Note, due to github size constraints, the training data is split into two zip files, training1.zip and training2.zip

In the training directories, there is one subdirectory for each of the 43 classes (0000 - 00043).
Each subdirectory contains the corresponding training images for that class.

The images are jpeg images (RGB color). Files are numbered in two parts:

   XXXXX_YYYYY.ppm

The first part, XXXXX, represents the track number. All images of one class 
with identical track numbers originate from one single physical traffic sign.

The second part, YYYYY, is a running number within the track. The temporal order
of the images is preserved.


# Test Images

The images are jpeg images (RGB color). Files are numbered in ascending order:

   00000.ppm to 12629.ppm

Images are in random order, ie. there is no track structure or class information
as in the training set.

The class labels for the test images are stored in a file called test_classes.csv
