These datasets contain information from the Spotify API.

The features provided are mostly values from the Audio Features endpoint (such as valence, danceability, etc...), but there are also a couple of features (such as popularity) that come from the Track Features endpoint.

Note that "genre" in the datasets that contain that feature, is tied to an artist, rather than a particular song. 

Aggregated datasets (by artist, year, and genre) contain the mean value of the continuous features, and the mode of categorical features.

Descriptions of each feature and the values they contain can be found in the Spotify API documentation:
