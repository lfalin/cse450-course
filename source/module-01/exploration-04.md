## Overview

In this data exploration, you will:

* Become familiar with the Scikit Learn machine learning library
* Use the library to build a machine learning model.
* Use that model to make predictions.

Throughout this exploration, when you're asked to use a new function or library, we'll usually provide a link to that function's documentation, or a tutorial related to it.

## Introduction

As with our previous data explorations, this assignment uses [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com). For more information on using Google Colab, including how to submit assignments with it, please see the information in [Data Exploration 01](./exploration-01.html) 

## Assignment

You're working with a team of botanists to develop a flower classification system. 

Your assignment is to build a k-Nearest Neighbors model to classify flowers based on their petal and sepal sizes.

### Notes about the data

The dataset contains sepal and petal measurements for several samples of iris flowers.

Each row in the data is a *sample*. There are five columns. 

The first four columns contain the feature values for each sample: `sepal_length`, `sepal_width`, `petal_length`, and `petal_width`.

The fifth column, `species`, is our *target* value. 

Remember, the purpose of supervised learning is to build a model that can predict the target value from the feature values.
