## Overview

The objective of this module is to provide a real-world scenario in which you can practice using Neural Networks.

!!!time "Estimated Reading Time"
	Plan on around 120 - 240 minutes for this preparation reading, which consists of online reading and videos.

!!!note "Theory vs Practice"
	There is a lot of content to read this week. For the sake of the preparation quiz and Friday's discussion, you should go through everything in the *Theory* section below.

	The items in the *Practical* section are things you'll want to go through before you start in on the actual case study work on Monday.

## Preparation Reading

!!!def "Lots of Vocabulary"
	You will likely come across _a lot_ of new vocabulary as you study neural networks.

	[This resource from Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary) provides
	a nice reference.

### Reading Part 1 - Theory

This video from MIT does a great job of introducing all of the high level concepts of how neural networks work, and how they can be used to solve machine learning problems.

The following three videos give another perspective about neural networks and go into a bit more detail on gradient descent and back propagation:

### Reading Part 2 - Practical

* Read [this article on Activation Functions](./activation-functions.html)
* Read [this article on Hyperparameters](https://missinglink.ai/guides/neural-network-concepts/hyperparameters-optimization-methods-and-real-world-model-management/)
* Read [this collection of tutorials on the Keras library](./keras.html)
