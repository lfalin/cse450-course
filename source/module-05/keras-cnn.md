## Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras

We'll be using Keras for creating convolutional neural networks. Much of what you learned in Module 04 will be applicable to this module. 

However, there are some additional APIs and concepts you'll need to review.

### Tutorials to Review

Please go through the following Keras tutorials:

* [Loading Image Data](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images)
* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn)
* [Image Classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification)
* [Data Augmentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation)
* [Fine Tuning an Image Classification Model of Cats vs Dogs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/transfer_learning#an_end-to-end_example_fine-tuning_an_image_classification_model_on_a_cats_vs_dogs)
