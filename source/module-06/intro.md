## Introduction
You've been hired by HackPressIO, a new content creation startup, to assist with their content creation.

## Stakeholders

These are the individuals your team will be helping during the case study:

<div class="dialogue">
	<img src="{{URLROOT}}/shared/img/thomas.jpg">
	<h5>Thomas, COO of HackPressIO</h5>
	<blockquote><p>We've recently acquired the rights to the estates of several deceased authors. We're experimenting with a concept where we train AI models from their published works, and use those models to generate new works with their style and voice.</p><p>We had hired a team to work on this project, but there were some technical issues they couldn't overcome. My little brother Johnny suggested we bring you on board to try and save the project.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
	<img src="{{URLROOT}}/shared/img/monika.jpg">
	<h5>Monika, Senior Developer</h5>
	<blockquote><p>We have a lot of the scaffolding for the project in place, but the models need a lot of refinement. I'll give you full access to the code implemented by the previous team, and I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have about it.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
	<img src="{{URLROOT}}/shared/img/johnny.jpg">
	<h5>Johnny, Data Science Intern</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Hey!</p><p>Isn't Thomas great? He's always been an inspiration to me, and one of the reasons I got into machine learning in the first place. It would mean a lot to me if you can help him out.</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>

!!!note "Stakeholder Focus Areas"
	The stakeholders are particularly interested in:

	1.	Building a recurrent neural network pipeline that can take an arbitrary collection of written works by an author, and generate new text with that author's style and voice.

You've been invited to a strategy meeting tomorrow.
