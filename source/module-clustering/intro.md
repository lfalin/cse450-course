## Introduction
You’re working as a data analyst for Red Mic LLC, a company that specializes in manufacturing professional grade microphones for musicians and newscasters.

Recently, a rival company (Green Audio Inc) announced that they were launching a set of initiatives to take their organization into the twenty-first century.

After a heated shareholders meeting, the board of directors has tasked the CEO with making sure Red Mic LLC isn’t left behind.

	<p>I came to Red Mic three years ago and have spent most of my time since working on employee on-boarding and retention. I'm excited to see what data science can bring to the table.</blockquote>

	<h5>William, the VP of Finance</h5>

	<p>I'll admit, I'm a bit skeptical of this so-called "data science". I like my data kept in Excel spreadsheets where I can keep an eye on it.</p></blockquote>

	<h5>Devon, the CEO</h5>

	<h5>Johnny, the data science intern</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Welcome to Red Mic! I'm so glad you're here, now I'm officially not the newest person on the team! What's your favorite Python library?</p>

!!!note "Stakeholder Focus Areas"
	The shareholders are particularly interested in the following areas:

	1.	Making sure Red Mic LLC has a diverse workforce.
	2.	Ensuring that employees with similar positions and experience are receiving equitable pay, regardless of race, gender, or marital status.
	3.	Striving to reduce employee turnover by actively measuring employee satisfaction and engagement, as well as engaging employees in special projects.
	4.	Analyzing what work-life balance issues might exist in the workforce that could be negatively impacting employee performance and longevity.

You're about to go into a strategy meeting with the CEO, Vice President of Human Resources, and Vice President of Finance. They want to make sure you have the data required to answer the questions they're most interested in.
