The objective of this module is to provide a real-world scenario in which you can practice the following data science / machine learning skills:

* The k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
* Similarity / Distance Metrics
* Evaluating how well a model makes predictions for continuous targets.

## Preparation Reading

!!!note "Reading the Text"
	As you read the chapters in the textbook, you may find it useful to start with the chapter summary at the end of the chapter. 

	This summary provides an overview of the key concepts presented in the chapter, and shows how each is connected together.
